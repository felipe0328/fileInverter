# FileInverter

FileInverter was crated with the purpose of having a file.txt get the file inverted in the oposite direction, for example if the file was:
```
This is a test
File Created for test
Purposes
```

the expected inverted file will be:
```
sesopruP
tset rof detaerC eliF
tset a si sihT
```

# How To run

To run the project go to the folder and type
``go mod tidy`` to start the project
``go run .`` to run the file inverter

inside the project is a ``test.txt`` file, that is the file that is going to be inverted, and you will see a ``inverted_test.txt`` file in your folder containing the inverted result
